# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Q: Can I use Namalsk Island without Namalsk Survival and vice versa?**

A: Yes.

**Q: Can I monetize my server when using Namalsk Terrain and/or Namalsk Survival mods?**

A: No, use Steam Workshop collections!

**Q: Is Namalsk compatible with X?**

A: I do not have any comprehensive list of what works with it and what not. What I can say is that I tried to make both Namalsk Terrain and Namalsk Survival as light as possible to make sure it is compatible with plenty of mods out there.

**Q: Can my mod somehow detect Namalsk?**

A: Yes, quite possibly - using script #ifdef NAMALSK_SURVIVAL and/or NAMALSK_TERRAIN.

**Q: What is the suggested player count for Namalsk?**

A: From my experience, I would recommend setting the maximum to 30-40 players.
